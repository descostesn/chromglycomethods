I. [Description](#description)  

Genome browser view of O-GlcNac, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac at the Zfp639 and Mfn1 genes. The peaks of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac indicates that both genes are actively transcribed. However, O-GlcNac peak can be seen at Zfp639 but not at Mfn1. This example indicates that O-GlcNac is seen at a subset of active promoters.
